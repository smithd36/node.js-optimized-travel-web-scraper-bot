# node.js-web-scraper
This is a web scraper built using Node.js and Puppeteer, a headless browser automation library. The scraper allows you to extract data from web pages by navigating through them, interacting with elements, and retrieving desired information.

# Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraper.git
Navigate to the project directory:
- cd web-scraper
Install the required dependencies using npm:
- npm install
Make sure you have Puppeteer installed. If not, you can install it using npm:

- npm install puppeteer

# Usage
Open the scraper.js file in a text editor.

Modify the script according to your scraping requirements. You can define the target URLs, specify the elements to interact with, extract data, and perform any necessary operations.

Save the changes to the scraper.js file.

In your terminal, run the following command to start the web scraper:
- node scraper.js
The scraper will launch a headless browser and start navigating through the specified URLs. It will interact with elements, extract data, and display the results in the terminal.

# Customization
You can customize the web scraper to suit your specific needs. Here are a few areas you might consider modifying:

Target URLs: Update the array of URLs in the scraper.js file to specify the web pages you want to scrape.

Element selection: Use Puppeteer's DOM manipulation and querying functions to select specific elements on the page. Modify the script to interact with the desired elements and extract the required data.

Data extraction: Use Puppeteer's methods to extract data from the selected elements. You can retrieve text content, attribute values, or other relevant information from the web page.

Error handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle any issues that may arise during the scraping process. You can catch and log errors, retry failed operations, or implement other error recovery strategies.
